# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Finance

Hi everyone,

This repository is a part of the effort to understand various ways in which Reinforcement Learning can be used in the finance domain.
This will mostly contain assignments from the Stanford CME 241 course.
See http://web.stanford.edu/class/cme241/

Most of the assignments need the framework from this Git Repo: https://github.com/TikhonJelvis/RL-book

We will also follow the accompanying book for the course: https://stanford.edu/~ashlearn/RLForFinanceBook/book.pdf
